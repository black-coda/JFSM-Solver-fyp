\textit{This research presents a solver developed using Flutter for solving stiff systems of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) through a unified implementation of collocation multistep methods. The application provides solutions to differential equations and offers a comprehensive analysis of Linear Multistep Methods (LMM), including error constants, zero stability checks, and convergence assessments. Numerical examples demonstrate the solver's accuracy and functionality across various scenarios. Detailed analyses of methods such as Quadeâ€™s method, Adams-Bashforth, Adams-Moulton, and Backward Differentiation Formula confirm the theoretical results with computational outputs. The results establish the solver's effectiveness and robustness, making it a valuable tool for numerical analysis in practical applications, capable of solving both non-stiff and stiff differential equations.}
