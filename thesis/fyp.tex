% Abstract
\begin{abstract}




This research focuses on the development and evaluation of a  numerical solver designed to solve differential equations efficiently. The solver's performance is assessed through detailed numerical examples, specifically focusing on linear multistep methods. We analyze Quade's Method and the 3-Step Backward Differentiation Formula (BDF), verifying their orders and stability characteristics. Quade's Method is shown to be a sixth-order method with an error constant of \(-0.0090\), while the 3-Step BDF is determined to be a third-order method with an error constant of \(-0.1364\). The proposed solver, referred to as the JF-Solver, is demonstrated to accurately replicate these theoretical results and perform stability and convergence analyses effectively.

The JF-Solver is further validated by comparing it to the Adams-Bashforth and Adams-Moulton methods in solving differential equations. For non-stiff problems, the solver is tested using the Adams-Bashforth 3-step method, and for stiff problems, it is tested using the Adams-Moulton 4-step method. The results show that the JF-Solver not only provides accurate approximations but also offers superior computation speed and efficiency. This comprehensive analysis highlights the JF-Solver's potential as a valuable tool for numerical analysis in solving both non-stiff and stiff differential equations.
