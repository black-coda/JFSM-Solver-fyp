% Abstract
\begin{abstract}
  In this research, we present a Solver developed using Flutter aimed at solving stiff systems of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) through a unified implementation of collocation multistep methods. The application not only provides solutions to differential equations but also offers comprehensive analysis of Linear Multistep Methods (LMM). It calculates error constants, checks for zero stability, and assesses convergence. Numerical examples illustrate the accuracy and functionality of the solver, showcasing its performance across various scenarios. Detailed analyses of methods such as Quadeâ€™s method, Adams-Bashforth, Adams-Moulton, and Backward Differentiation Formula confirm the theoretical results with computational outputs. The results demonstrate the solver's effectiveness and robustness, establishing it as a valuable tool for numerical analysis in practical applications. solving both non-stiff and stiff differential equations.
