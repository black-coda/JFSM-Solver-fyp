  abstract = {In this study, an optimal L-stable time-efficient hybrid block method with a relative measure of stability is developed for solving stiff systems in ordinary differential equations. The derivation resorts to interpolation and collocation techniques over a single step with two intermediate points, resulting in an efficient one-step method. The optimization of the two off-grid points is achieved by means of the local truncation error (LTE) of the main formula. The theoretical analysis shows that the method is consistent, zero-stable, seventh-order convergent for the main formula, and L-stable. The highly stiff systems solved with the proposed and other algorithms (even of higher-order than the proposed one) proved the efficiency of the former in the context of several types of errors, precision factors, and computational time.}

ABSTRACT = {In this paper, we compare a multi-step method and a multi-stage method for stiff initial value problems. Traditionally, the multi-step method has been preferred than the multi-stage for a stiff problem, to avoid an enormous amount of computational costs required to solve a massive linear system provided by the linearization of a highly stiff system. We investigate the possibility of usage of multi-stage methods for stiff systems by discussing the difference between the two methods in several numerical experiments. Moreover, the advantages of multi-stage methods are heuristically presented even for nonlinear stiff systems through several numerical tests.},

They have potential applications, especially for stiff problems. This paper discusses stiffness and emphasises the need for efficient implicit methods for the solution of stiff problems. In this context, a survey of general linear methods is presented, including recent results on methods with the inherent RK stability property.}
